Revision history for perl distribution Graph-ReadWrite

2.01 2012-02-12

    - renamed ChangeLog to Changes and reformatted as per CPAN::Changes::Spec

2.00 2005-01-02

	- made the changes needed to work with version 0.5 of Graph classes
	- patch to Graph::Reader::Dot from Mark Hillebrand.
	- fixed warnings "Using a hash as a reference is deprecated"
	- added support for new Dot attributes to Graph::Reader::Dot
	- node ids are now quoted in Graph::Writer::Dot,
	  which means you can safely have space, ':', '-', and other
	  interesting characters in node ids.

1.06 2002-07-09

	- Added XML::Parser and XML::Writer as dependencies in Makefile.PL.
	  This was prompted by looking at testers.cpan.org, which has
	  this distribution as failing.

1.05 2002-03-20

	- Graph::Writer::VCG - common attributes (label, color, and
	  text color) weren't supported on edges.
	  Bug and fix reported by Alexandre Cherif.
    - Oops, did I really do two 1.05 releases?!

1.05 2002-01-20

	- Added a basic test-suite.
	- Commented out debugging output in the HTK Writer. Sorry Phil!

104 2001-11-11

	- Added Graph::Reader::Dot, a reader for the Dot format
	  contributed by Mark Hillebrand.

	- Fixed a bug in Graph::Reader::XML, found by Mark Hillebrand.
	  The reader would only cope with a single <attribute> element
	  inside each graph, node or edge element.

	- Changed contact email address to neil at bowers dot com

1.03

	- Added reader and writer classes for HTK lattice files.

1.02

	- Fixed a bug in the XML writer module - the way it was using
	  XML::Writer caused STDOUT to be closed after you've written
	  a graph. I consider it a bug in XML::Writer, but I was able
	  to change the way Graph::Writer::XML uses that module.

	  Basically it just means that we construct a new instance
	  of XML::Writer every time we write out a graph. For most
	  uses, this won't be a problem, but you'd notice a hit if
	  you were creating the writer and then writing a lot of graphs.

	  This was noticed by Mike Hayward <hayward@loup.net>

1.01

	- Added support for URL attribute on nodes in Dot.
	- Added support for almost all attributes understood by VCG.
	- Added a rough cut at a Writer class for daVinci: Graph::Writer::daVinci

1.00 2001-02

	- Initial release - has baseclass for Reader and Writer classes.
	- Reader and Writer for simple XML format.
	- Writers for Dot and VCG formats.
